# Changelog

## 2026-06-22

- Added visible `Tool Palette` and `Layout Tools` section labels to clarify the left design tools and bottom layout toolbar.
- Changed bundled templates to blank starting templates for 2.25 x 0.75 and 4 x 2 label stock.
- Added `docs/MANUAL_QA_CHECKLIST.md` and `docs/PRINTER_CALIBRATION.md`.
- Added persistent CSV print history at `logs\print_history.csv` for successful and failed print jobs.
- Updated packaging to create `LabelPrinterApp_Portable.zip` and a beta `LabelPrinterApp_Setup.exe` when `iexpress.exe` is available.
- Made Landscape the default label orientation for stock/templates and added working Grid and Snap toolbar toggles, including app-settings persistence and 0.25 inch snap-to-grid movement.
- Regenerated bundled templates into two clear test-template sets for 2.25 x 0.75 and 4 x 2 label stock, using `TEST LABEL`, `Test description`, and `TEST-001` style sample values.
- Updated sample CSV files to use matching test label data.
- Restored reliable increase-arrow clicks on numeric fields by leaving spinbox button rendering to the native Qt/Windows control and applying sizing in code instead of the global stylesheet.
- Added persistent app settings with load-on-startup, save-on-close, manual Save App Settings, and Reset App Settings actions for printer, stock, label setup, print options, active tab, and window layout.
- Restored native spinbox arrow rendering while keeping numeric fields tall enough for reliable increase/decrease clicks.
- Fixed spinbox stepper hit areas so the increase arrows on numeric fields are clickable.
- Updated all `docs/` files for the current architecture, classic designer UI, functional inspector pages, layout controls, packaging behavior, and current generated ZPL example.
- Renamed the right-side inspector header to `Element Property Editor`.
- Changed the right-side inspector buttons into true filtered pages for Text, Formatting, Position, Data, Barcode, and Print, including visible Do not print and Locked controls.
- Wired inspector section buttons to jump to the matching editor fields and connected layout toolbar actions for align, equal spacing, layer order, lock, and unlock.
- Reworked the text formatting checkboxes into one horizontal Style row in the properties inspector.
- Increased checkbox contrast in the properties inspector so Bold, Italic, Underline, Wrap, and Auto-fit states are easier to see.
- Improved designer usability with readable left toolbox labels, brighter selection boxes and handles, a two-row inspector selector, wrapped property rows, scrollable property editing, and resizable design sections.
- Restyled the design workspace toward a classic LabelDirect/ZebraDesigner layout with a light theme, dense menus/toolbars, compact left tool palette, rulered canvas, dashed printable boundary, selection handles, inspector tabs, bottom alignment toolbar, and richer status bar.
- Fixed database printing so checked Excel/CSV rows print their own field values instead of repeating a fixed sample item number from the active template.
- Updated bundled item/barcode templates to use `{ItemNumber}`, `{Description}`, `{Lot}`, `{Order id}`, and `{Name}` placeholders where appropriate.
- Added an Excel database-style Data tab with `.xlsx`/CSV load, editable table records, print checkboxes, per-row copies, search, range selection, save/save-as, and label-template variable mapping from column headers.
- Added modular Excel records classes: `ExcelImporter`, `ExcelTableModel`, `ExcelRecordsWidget`, and `RecordRangeParser`.
- Added QXlsx FetchContent integration for workbook import/export in the Qt app.
- Added Label Stock presets for Uline S-8599, Uline S-22422, Zebra 2.25 x 0.75 generic stock, and Zebra ZD620 4 x 2 stock.
- Added automatic calculated dot-size display for the selected width, height, and DPI.
- Reordered tabs to `Design | Elements | Data | Templates | Print | Settings` and moved stock/default-printer setup into Settings.
- Updated the example ZPL to a centered 203 DPI Uline S-8599 test label.
- Updated bundled templates and sample CSV records to use visible sample label data built around the Code 128 value `226026-K-003`.
- Improved the visual barcode preview so Code 128 bars are generated from the encoded value instead of decorative placeholder stripes.
- Changed the element font size editor to a preset dropdown.
- Added an Installed Printer selector row with a Refresh button in the print settings panel.
- Added a photo-inspired work center dispatch template with rotated text, the item number `226026-K-003`, description text, date/time fields, and a Code 128 barcode.
- Improved preview rendering for rotated text and barcode elements.
