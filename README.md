# LabelPrinterApp

LabelPrinterApp is a Windows desktop app for making and printing Zebra ZPL labels. It is built for small 2.25 x 0.75 inch direct thermal removable adhesive labels, especially on Zebra ZD410-style printers.

The app lets you design a label, preview it, fill in values, import a CSV file, and send raw ZPL directly to a Windows printer.

## What You Can Do

- Design 2.25 x 0.75 inch Zebra labels for 203 DPI or 300 DPI printers.
- Add text, Code 128 barcodes, Code 39 barcodes, and QR codes.
- Move label items by dragging them in the preview.
- Show or hide the design grid and enable snap-to-grid placement from the toolbar.
- Work in focused tabs for Design, Elements, Data, Print, Templates, and Settings.
- Edit font size from a preset dropdown, plus bold, italic, underline, rotation, alignment, wrapping, margins, gap, darkness, speed, and copies.
- Use placeholders like `{ItemNumber}`, `{Lot}`, `{Date}`, `{Time}`, `{Serial}`, and `{RecordIndex}`.
- Print one label, a serial-number range, selected CSV rows, or every CSV row.
- Use a CSV `Quantity` or `Qty` column to print more than one label per row.
- Save and load label templates as JSON.
- Save and reset app settings so the selected printer, stock preset, label setup, active tab, and window layout survive restarts.

## Quick Start

1. Install the Zebra Windows printer driver.
2. Make sure the printer is set up for ZPL printing.
3. Open LabelPrinterApp.
4. Open the Settings tab and select your Zebra printer from the Default Printer list. Click `Refresh` if it was just plugged in or installed.
5. Pick a Label Stock preset, such as `Uline S-8599 - 2.25" x 0.75" Direct Thermal`. Landscape is the default orientation.
6. Click `Save Settings` if you want this printer and stock setup to load automatically next time.
7. Edit the label fields or drag items in the preview.
8. Print one test label before printing a batch.

## App Settings

LabelPrinterApp automatically loads saved app settings at startup and saves them again when the app closes. You can also use `Preferences > Save App Settings` or the Settings tab's `Save Settings` button at any time.

Saved settings include:

- Window size, position, splitter layout, and active tab
- Default printer
- Label stock preset, width, height, margins, gap, media sensing, orientation, and DPI
- Designer grid visibility and snap-to-grid toggle
- Print method, core size, speed, darkness, and copies

Use `Preferences > Reset App Settings` or `Reset Defaults` in the Settings tab to clear saved app settings and return to the bundled default label setup.

## Label Stock Presets

The Settings tab includes presets for:

- Custom
- Uline S-8599 - 2.25" x 0.75" Direct Thermal
- Uline S-22422 - 2.25" x 0.75" Removable Direct Thermal
- Zebra 2.25" x 0.75" Generic
- Zebra ZD620 - 4" x 2" Direct Thermal

For 2.25" x 0.75" labels, the calculated printer size is:

- 203 DPI: `457 x 152` dots
- 300 DPI: `675 x 225` dots

For 4" x 2" labels, the calculated printer size is:

- 203 DPI: `812 x 406` dots
- 300 DPI: `1200 x 600` dots

## Excel Database Printing

The Data tab is an editable records screen for `.xlsx` and `.csv` files. It includes:

- `Load...`, `Save`, and `Save As...`
- Search by any imported column
- A row number column
- A checkbox column to choose rows for printing
- A `Copies` column with values from 1 to 999
- Editable imported columns such as `{Order id}` and `{Name}`
- A range box such as `1-*`, `1-10`, `5`, `2,4,6`, or `1-5,8,10-12`

Checked rows that match the range are printed through the current label template. Imported headers become template variables, so an Excel column named `Order id` can be used as `{Order id}` in text, barcode, or QR fields.

Use `examples\excel_records_sample.csv` as quick test data. `.xlsx` files are supported in app builds through QXlsx.

## Printing From CSV

Use `examples\sample_items.csv` as a starting point:

```csv
ItemNumber,Description,Lot,Quantity
TEST-001,"Test description",TEST-LOT-001,2
```

In the app:

1. Click `Import CSV`.
2. Choose your CSV file.
3. Click `Map CSV` if your column names do not match the placeholders in the template.
4. Select rows and click `Print Selected CSV`, or click `Print All CSV`.

Template text, barcode values, and QR values can all use placeholders. For example:

```text
ITEM {ItemNumber}
{ItemNumber}|{Lot}|{Date}
```

## Default Label

The default template is [templates/default_label.json](templates/default_label.json). It includes:

- A title with `TEST LABEL`
- A description field with `Test description`
- A Code 128 barcode encoding `TEST-001`
- A QR code with test label data

The `templates/` folder includes two template sets: one for 2.25 x 0.75 inch labels and one for Zebra ZD620-style 4 x 2 inch labels. Open the `Templates` tab and double-click a template to load it. The bundled barcode templates use test values such as `TEST-001`, `TEST-002`, and `TEST-003` so sample prints are clearly marked as test labels.

## Building From Source

Requirements:

- Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 or newer with Desktop development with C++
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- Qt 6 for MSVC 64-bit
- Internet access on first configure if QXlsx has not already been fetched

Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to your Qt install folder:

```powershell
$env:CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH = "C:\Qt\6.7.3\msvc2022_64"
.\scripts\build-and-test.ps1 -Config Release
```

On this development machine, the script auto-detects `C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64`, so the normal VS Code build task can run without extra arguments.

`.xlsx` support is enabled by default with `LABELPRINTERAPP_ENABLE_XLSX=ON`. CMake fetches QXlsx automatically and links it into the Qt application.

Or run CMake directly:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

## Packaging

Build a distributable folder:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-release.ps1 -Config Release
```

The package is written to `dist\LabelPrinterApp`. If `windeployqt.exe` is available, the Qt runtime files are copied automatically.
