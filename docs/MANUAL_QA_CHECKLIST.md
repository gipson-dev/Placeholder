## Portable Package

- [ ] Copy `dist\LabelPrinterApp` to a USB folder.

## Self-Update

- [ ] Install an older build of `LabelPrinterApp_Portable.zip` in its own folder.
- [ ] Launch it and confirm a status-bar message reports the update result a few seconds after startup (up to date, downloaded, or check failed).
- [ ] With a newer release already published, confirm the silent startup check reports a downloaded update and offers to restart.
- [ ] Click `Yes` to restart and confirm `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe` applies the update and relaunches `LabelPrinterApp.exe`.

- [ ] Extract `LabelPrinterApp_Portable.zip` to a clean folder and run the app.
- [ ] Confirm `dist\LabelPrinterApp_Setup.exe` exists.
- [ ] Run `LabelPrinterApp_Setup.exe` on a test machine or VM.
- [ ] Confirm it extracts to the user-local install folder and starts the app.
