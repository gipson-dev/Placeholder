# LabelPrinterApp Architecture

LabelPrinterApp is a Windows C++17 Qt 6 Widgets application for designing and printing Zebra ZPL labels. The default stock is a 2.25 x 0.75 inch direct thermal removable adhesive label for Zebra ZD410-style printers, with 203 DPI and 300 DPI support. The app sends final ZPL through the Windows RAW spooler path.

## Core Classes

- `PrinterSettings` stores printer name, DPI, label size, margins, gap, media sensing mode, orientation, darkness, speed, and copies.
- `LabelElement` models text, Code 128, Code 39, QR, Line, and Box elements. It stores content, source mode, variable name, prefix/suffix, X/Y position, text formatting, shape dimensions, barcode settings, QR settings, `doNotPrint`, and `locked`.
- `LabelTemplate` owns printer settings and the ordered element list. Element order is used as the preview and print layer order.
- `VariableResolver` resolves `{Placeholders}`, date/time values, serial numbers, record indexes, and prefix/suffix formatting before preview/print.
- `ZplGenerator` converts templates into ZPL using `^PW`, `^LL`, `^LH`, `^MN`, `^FW`, text, Code 128, Code 39, QR, and graphic box commands. Field data is escaped for unsafe ZPL characters, and normal text output applies the same visual-origin correction used by the designer preview.
- `ZebraPrinter` enumerates installed Windows printers and sends raw ZPL using `OpenPrinterA`, `StartDocPrinterA`, `WritePrinter`, and `ClosePrinter`.
- `TemplateStorage` saves and loads JSON templates with nlohmann/json, including the current lock and do-not-print element flags.
- `CsvImporter` parses quoted CSV data and detects headers.
- `ExcelImporter`, `ExcelRecordSet`, `ExcelTableModel`, and `ExcelRecordsWidget` provide the editable `.xlsx`/CSV database workflow through QXlsx.
- `RecordRangeParser` parses row ranges such as `1-*`, `1-10`, `2,4,6`, and `1-5,8`.
- `AppUpdater` wraps `labelprinterapp::update::manager` from the vendored `c-updater` library. It checks the `gipson-dev/LabelPrinterApp` GitHub releases for a newer version, downloads and verifies it in the background, and hands off to `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe` to apply it and relaunch the app.

## UI Classes

- `MainWindow` wires menus, toolbars, tab pages, template actions, printer settings, stock presets, persistent app settings, database printing, raw print commands, the `AppUpdater`-backed self-update check (silent on startup, manual from `Help > Check for Updates`), and the `View > Print History` viewer.
- `PreviewWidget` paints the classic designer canvas with rulers, optional grid, label boundary, printable margin, vertically centered text, barcode/QR/shape previews, selection handles, marquee multi-selection, cursor coordinates, drag-to-move positioning, group dragging, side/corner resize handles, and optional 0.25 inch snap-to-grid movement. Barcode bounds use shared Zebra module-count sizing, and centered/right-aligned barcodes are positioned from the resolved print value so variable data stays aligned. Locked elements cannot be dragged or resized.
- `ElementEditorWidget` is the right-side `Element Property Editor`. Its section buttons are true filtered pages:
  - `Text`: name, type, and element text
  - `Formatting`: font size, width, bold, italic, underline, wrap, auto-fit, max lines, and alignment
  - `Position`: X, Y, box width, and rotation
  - `Data`: source, variable, prefix, and suffix
  - `Barcode`: barcode height, module width, human-readable toggle, or QR magnification
  - `Print`: do-not-print and locked flags
- `ExcelRecordsWidget` is the Data tab table for loading, editing, filtering, selecting, and printing imported records.

## Print History

Print attempts append to `logs\print_history.csv`. The file is created automatically with these columns:

```text
Timestamp,Printer,Template,Mode,Rows,Copies,Success,Message
```

It logs successful and failed print sends, including missing-printer failures. `View > Print History` opens an in-app viewer (`MainWindow::showPrintHistory`) that reads the CSV back through `CsvImporter` into a `QTableWidget`, shown most-recent-first with the `Success` column color-coded and a `Refresh` button to reload after new print jobs. The viewer is read-only; exporting, clearing, and reprinting from history are not implemented yet (see [docs/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).

## Designer Controls

The Design tab uses a classic label-designer layout:

- Left readable toolbox: Canvas Template selector, Select, Text, Number, Description, Barcode, QR Code, Date/Time, Serial #, Line, Box, and Image.
- Center preview canvas with rulers, optional grid, printable margin, vertically centered text, shape rendering, and selection handles.
- Right `Element Property Editor` with filtered property pages.
- Bottom layout toolbar:
  - Align left, center, right, top, middle, and bottom
  - Equal horizontal spacing for three or more selected elements
  - Bring forward and send backward for layer order
  - Lock and unlock selected elements

Multiple elements can be selected by dragging a marquee on empty canvas space or Ctrl-clicking individual elements. Alignment commands operate on the selected group's bounds when more than one element is selected. For a single barcode, Align center/right sets a full-label alignment lane and generated ZPL offsets the barcode by the resolved printed value width.

## Persistent App Settings

The main window uses Qt `QSettings` with the `LabelPrinterApp/LabelPrinterApp` organization/application keys. Settings are loaded after the default template and printer list are initialized, saved automatically on close, and can be saved or reset from the Preferences menu and Settings tab.

Persisted values include the window geometry/state, active tab, selected printer, DPI, stock preset, label dimensions, margins, gap, media sensing, orientation, grid visibility, snap-to-grid, print method, core size, speed, darkness, and copies. Template layout remains template-driven JSON so user label designs can still be saved and shared separately.

## Self-Updating Releases

`AppUpdater` (`core/AppUpdater.h/.cpp`) owns a `labelprinterapp::update::manager` from the vendored [`c-updater`](../c-updater/README.md) library:

- On startup, `MainWindow` waits four seconds, then runs a silent `checkForUpdates()` and reports the result on the status bar.
- `Help > Check for Updates` runs the same check, but reports results with message boxes since the user explicitly asked for them.
- On `updateReady`, the app asks the user whether to restart. If they accept, `applyDownloadedUpdateAndRestart()` launches `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe` (built from `launcher/main.cpp`) with the update working directory and the downloaded version's directory name, then the app quits.
- `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe` is a small, statically linked, Qt-free executable (linked against `labelprinterapp_update_manager` only) so it has no DLL dependencies of its own and can keep running while the app directory it was launched from is replaced. It applies the downloaded update, retains the `templates` and `logs` folders via `manager::retain_installed_files`, and starts `LabelPrinterApp.exe` again.
- If `AppUpdater::isAvailable()` is false (for example, another running instance holds the update lock), `Help > Check for Updates` instead opens the GitHub releases page for `gipson-dev/LabelPrinterApp`.

`c-updater` is vendored as plain tracked source under `c-updater/`, including its `nlohmann/json`, `googletest`, and `minizip-ng` dependencies, so CI and fresh clones can build it without extra setup or submodule steps. It additionally requires OpenSSL (see [Build In Visual Studio](#build-in-visual-studio)).

## Version Coverage

- Version 1: basic input, font size/width, X/Y position, copies, valid ZPL, and RAW printing.
- Version 2: Qt GUI, preview, multiple elements, add/edit/delete, JSON templates, and printer selection.
- Version 3: Code 128, Code 39, QR, Line, Box, barcode height, module width, human-readable toggle, and shape output.
- Version 4: placeholders, prompt-at-print values, date/time tokens, serial numbers, prefix/suffix, and serial ranges.
- Version 5: CSV and `.xlsx` import, header mapping, record preview, selected/all row printing, Number/Description field workflow, and placeholder replacement in text/barcode/QR fields.
- `v1.0.0`: self-updating release delivery through the vendored `c-updater` library and `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe`.

## Build In Visual Studio

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 or newer with "Desktop development with C++".
2. Install Qt 6 for MSVC 64-bit.
3. Install OpenSSL for the `c-updater` update checker. Windows builds auto-detect `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64` when present; otherwise pass `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-openssl>`.
4. Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` if Qt is not auto-detected:

```powershell
$env:CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH = "C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64"
```

5. Build and test:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-and-test.ps1 -Config Release
```

The helper script finds Visual Studio's bundled CMake and local Qt installs under `C:\Qt\*\msvc2022_64`. The build uses a single worker to avoid MSVC/QXlsx PDB lock races.

Direct CMake commands also work:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 1
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

## VS Code C/C++ IntelliSense

The C++ extension reads `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` for IntelliSense include paths. The workspace includes:

- `${workspaceFolder}`
- `${workspaceFolder}/core`
- `${workspaceFolder}/ui`
- `${workspaceFolder}/build/_deps/nlohmann_json-src/include`
- `${workspaceFolder}/build-core/_deps/nlohmann_json-src/include`
- `${workspaceFolder}/build-qt-verify/_deps/nlohmann_json-src/include`
- Qt include folders from `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or `C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64`

This resolves the `nlohmann/json.hpp` include used by `core/TemplateStorage.cpp` after the project has been configured or built at least once.

## Packaging

Create a distributable folder:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-release.ps1 -Config Release
```

The package is written to `dist\LabelPrinterApp`, including `LabelPrinterApp.exe` and `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe`. The script fails fast if either executable is missing from the build output. Close any running copy of `dist\LabelPrinterApp\LabelPrinterApp.exe` before packaging so Windows can replace Qt DLLs.

The package script also writes:

- `dist\LabelPrinterApp_Portable.zip`
- `dist\LabelPrinterApp_Setup.exe`, when `iexpress.exe` is available

The setup EXE is a beta convenience wrapper around the portable ZIP.

## Test Printing

1. Install the Zebra Windows driver and configure the printer for ZPL mode.
2. Open Settings and select the installed printer.
3. Choose a stock preset such as `Uline S-8599 - 2.25" x 0.75" Direct Thermal`.
4. Match the DPI to the printer, usually 203 or 300.
5. Use `Print Test Label` first.
6. Load `examples\sample_items.csv` or `examples\excel_records_sample.csv` from the Data tab for variable database printing, then add `Number` and `Description` fields.
7. Print one label and verify alignment before printing a batch.

For 2.25 x 0.75 stock, expected dot sizes are `457 x 152` at 203 DPI and `675 x 225` at 300 DPI.
