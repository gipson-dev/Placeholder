# LabelPrinterApp Roadmap

## Project Goal

Build a Windows desktop label-design and Zebra-printing application for custom text, number, barcode, QR, line, box, and batch labels. The application supports editable templates, Excel/CSV data import, print preview, Zebra ZPL output, printer settings, print history, developer-friendly local setup, and release packaging.

The current application covers the requested Version 1 through Version 5 feature set and includes the classic desktop designer UI pass. `v1.0.0` has been tagged and published as a GitHub release, and the app can now check for and apply newer releases on its own. Clean-machine and physical-printer QA hardening from the beta phase continues in parallel; see [Known Remaining Work](#known-remaining-work) and [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

## Release Status Overview

| Release Area | Status | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core label engine | Complete | Label model, ZPL generation, template storage, variable handling, and shape output are implemented. |
| Zebra printing | Complete | Windows RAW spooler printing is implemented. |
| Designer UI | Beta-ready | Classic designer layout, toolbox, canvas, rulers, grid, snap, marquee multi-select, group drag, inspector pages, inline text editing, and layout controls are functional. |
| Data import and batch printing | Beta-ready | Excel/CSV rows, checked rows, row ranges, copies, serial ranges, and placeholder mapping are implemented. |
| Packaging | Beta-ready | Release folder builds under `dist\LabelPrinterApp`; Qt runtime deployment is handled when available. |
| Self-updating releases | Complete | `Help > Check for Updates` and a silent startup check ask GitHub releases for `gipson-dev/LabelPrinterApp`, download and verify newer `LabelPrinterApp_Portable.zip` builds in the background, and hand off to `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe` to apply the update and relaunch, retaining `templates\` and `logs\`. |
| Developer setup | Beta-ready | CMake/Qt build path is documented and VS Code C/C++ IntelliSense resolves fetched `nlohmann/json.hpp` after configure/build. |
| Testing and calibration | In progress | Automated core tests exist; physical printer calibration and clean-machine manual QA remain. |
| Production polish | In progress | Image/logo support, print history viewer, installer polish, version display, and final calibration controls remain. |

| 21 | Self-updating releases | Complete | Vendored `c-updater` (with its `nlohmann/json`, `googletest`, and `minizip-ng` dependencies) as tracked source, added `core/AppUpdater`, wired a startup check plus `Help > Check for Updates` in `MainWindow`, added the `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe` update-apply/relaunch helper, and bumped the project version to `1.0.0` for release-version comparisons. |

## Current Completed Highlights

- Classic light desktop UI with menu bar, dense toolbar, readable left toolbox, rulered canvas, printable margin, and bottom alignment toolbar.
- Working Grid and Snap toolbar toggles with optional 0.25 inch snapped element movement.
- Right-side `Element Property Editor` with filtered pages for Text, Formatting, Position, Data, Barcode, and Print.
- Functional bottom layout controls for align, equal spacing, bring forward, send backward, lock, and unlock.
- Excel/CSV Data tab with load/save, editable rows, print checkboxes, copies, search, row ranges, placeholder mapping, and standard `Number`/`Description` fields.

- Persistent CSV print history for successful and failed print jobs.
- Release package output under `dist\LabelPrinterApp`.
- VS Code C/C++ IntelliSense include paths for fetched `nlohmann/json.hpp` in the local build folders.
- Self-updating releases: a startup check plus `Help > Check for Updates` download and verify newer GitHub releases in the background and relaunch through `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe` to apply them, keeping `templates\` and `logs\` intact.
- `v1.0.0` tagged and published as a GitHub release.

## Immediate Next Order

1. Run the manual QA checklist against the `v1.0.0` package on a clean Windows machine, including the update-check/apply/relaunch flow end to end against a real newer release.
2. Run physical printer calibration checks on both 203 DPI and 300 DPI Zebra printers.
3. Fix issues found during clean-machine and printer testing, especially runtime files, startup path, templates, settings, print offsets, DPI scaling, font preview differences, barcode sizing, and CSV/Excel edge cases.
4. Add the remaining high-value production features: image/logo support, print history viewer/export, keyboard nudging, calibration offset controls, installer polish, in-app version display, screenshots, and release notes.
5. Cut the next patch/point release once clean-machine and printer QA sign off.

## Manual QA Checklist Summary

- Startup: launch from `dist\LabelPrinterApp`, move the folder, reboot, verify no developer tools are required, and confirm missing files produce understandable errors.
- Designer: add text, barcode, QR, line, and box; edit text inline; marquee-select multiple elements; group-drag and align selected elements; verify barcode center alignment against printed output; move, resize, lock, unlock, delete, duplicate, cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, zoom, grid, and snap.
- Properties: verify Text, Formatting, Position, Data, Barcode, and Print pages update the selected element and that do-not-print prevents output.
- Templates: load blank 2.25 x 0.75 and 4 x 2 templates, save custom templates, reopen saved templates, and verify element metadata survives reload.
- Data import: load CSV and Excel, edit/save rows, search, print checked rows, print all rows, print ranges, print quantity per row, and verify `Number`/`Description` placeholders.
- Printing: select Zebra printer, print one label, print copies, print checked rows, print serial ranges, and test DPI, darkness, speed, orientation, margins, and gap sensing.
- Scan validation: scan Code 128, Code 39, and QR output and confirm encoded data matches expected values.
- History: verify successful and failed jobs are logged to `logs\print_history.csv` and survive restart.
- Developer setup: open `core/TemplateStorage.cpp` in VS Code and confirm the C/C++ extension resolves `nlohmann/json.hpp` after a normal configure/build.
- Self-update: with an older build installed, confirm the silent startup check and `Help > Check for Updates` detect a newer published GitHub release, download and apply it through `LabelPrinterAppLauncher.exe`, relaunch the app, and keep `templates\` and `logs\` intact.

## Known Remaining Work

| Priority | Item | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High | Clean-machine package test | Confirms the app works outside the development PC. |
| High | Physical printer calibration | Confirms preview and print output match real labels. |
| High | 203/300 DPI validation | Prevents sizing and offset issues across printers. |
| High | Barcode/QR scan validation | Confirms production label usability. |
| Medium | Image/logo support | Common label-design requirement. |
| Medium | Print history viewer | Makes history usable without opening CSV manually. |
| Medium | Calibration offset controls | Helps correct printer/media differences. |
| Medium | Installer | Improves setup for non-technical users. |
| Medium | End-to-end self-update validation | Confirm the startup check, `Help > Check for Updates`, download/verify, and launcher relaunch work against a real published GitHub release, not just local builds. |
| Low | More stock presets | Useful after core stability is verified. |
| Low | More barcode types | Useful after the main workflow is stable. |
