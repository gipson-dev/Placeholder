# LabelPrinterApp Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the twenty-phase build plan. The current implementation covers the requested Version 1 through Version 5 feature set in the Qt 6 architecture.

| Phase | Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Setup and structure | Complete | Root CMake project with `core/`, `ui/`, `templates/`, `examples/`, and tests. |
| 2 | Label data model | Complete | `PrinterSettings`, `LabelElement`, and `LabelTemplate` model label size, DPI, elements, formatting, variables, and barcode options. |
| 3 | ZPL generator | Complete | Generates escaped ZPL for text, Code 128, Code 39, QR, media mode, orientation, margins, darkness, and speed. |
| 4 | Zebra printer communication | Complete | Windows RAW spooler printing uses `OpenPrinterA`, `StartDocPrinterA`, `WritePrinter`, and `ClosePrinter`. |
| 5 | Template storage | Complete | JSON load/save via nlohmann/json with fallback default templates. |
| 6 | UI wiring | Complete | Qt MainWindow wires printer settings, preview, template commands, element editor, CSV table, and printing. |
| 7 | Editable label fields | Complete | Add, edit, delete, position, and format label elements. |
| 8 | Barcode support | Complete | Code 128, Code 39, QR, height, module width, and human-readable toggle. |
| 9 | Better preview | Complete | Scaled preview with grid, text, barcode approximation, QR marker, selection outlines, and text alignment adjustment. |
| 10 | Template manager | Complete | Load and save JSON templates through the UI. |
| 11 | Printer settings | Complete | Printer, DPI, dimensions, margins, gap, sensing mode, orientation, speed, darkness, copies, and serial controls. |
| 12 | Error handling | Complete for foundation | User-facing save/print errors plus template fallback handling. |
| 13 | Print history | Deferred | The Version 5 rebuild prioritizes CSV and variable workflows; persistent history remains a later phase. |
| 14 | Batch printing | Complete | Copies, serial ranges, selected CSV rows, all CSV rows, and quantity-per-row printing. |
| 15 | Advanced formatting | Complete for foundation | Font, bold, italic, underline, rotation, alignment, wrapping, multiline, fixed/variable fields, prefix/suffix, and auto-fit metadata. |
| 16 | Drag-and-drop designer | Complete for foundation | Preview supports drag-to-move element positioning. Full designer handles/snapping remain future polish. |
| 17 | Packaging as EXE | Complete for foundation | Release packaging script copies app assets and runs `windeployqt` when available. |
| 18 | GitHub and releases | Started | GitHub Actions installs Qt, builds, and runs tests. Release artifact automation remains next. |
| 19 | Testing and calibration | Started | Core tests cover ZPL, CSV, variables, serial ranges, and template storage. Printer calibration checklist remains next. |
| 20 | Final polish | Not started | UI fit, validation depth, persistent settings, and full designer polish. |

## Next Order

1. Add a GitHub release workflow that publishes packaged EXE artifacts.
2. Add printer calibration notes for 203 DPI and 300 DPI Zebra media.
3. Add persistent app settings and print history storage.
